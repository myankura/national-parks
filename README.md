# National Parks

1. Clone down this repo.
1. `cd` into the repo.
1. To run json-server from command line, `json-server -w database.json -p 9099`.


Todayâ€™s exercise:

*Part One:*
Build an application using grunt to get data from the following API: https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-31/national-parks and display the list of national parks on the DOM. Each national park should be formatted in HTML like below:
```<article>
      <h3>Park Name</h3>
      <p>State the park in located in</p>
    </article>```
If the park has been visited, the article tag should have a red dashed border. If the park has not been visited, it should have a green solid border.

*Part Two:*
For each of the national parks, use the latitude and longitude to get the weather in that area using this API: https://darksky.net/dev. From the data coming back from the Dark Sky API, you are going to use `summary` listed under `currently`, `hourly` and `daily`. Change the html so it looks like this:
```<article>
      <h3>Park Name</h3>
      <p>State the park</p>
      <p>Weather:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Currently: Summary from currently in API Data</li>
        <li>Today: Summary from hourly in API Data</li>
        <li>Week: Summary from daily in API Data</li>
      </ul>
    </article>```

If you encounter CORS issues with the Dark Sky API, you can either get an extension for Chrome to work around it here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-orign-cors-changer/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc OR you can add this to the front of you URL: `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/`
